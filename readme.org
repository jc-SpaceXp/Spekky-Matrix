** Spekky Matrix
A FreeRTOS based project were a spectrum analyser is displayed on a LED matrix board run from a STM32 device
*** Detailed Description
A MAX7219 based 8x8 led matrix displays the fast fourier transform (FFT) of
an incoming audio signal picked up by a microphone. The incoming audio
is a double buffered DMA signal. The led matrix is driven via the STM32's
SPI interface. All while internal hardware timers and FreeRTOS are
responsible for accurate timing e.g. refresh rate of led matrix and data
acquisition.
*** Tools
The following tools are needed to build this project
- make
- [[https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm][arm-none-eabi-gcc]]
- [[https://gcc.gnu.org/][gcc]] (for unit tests)
- [[https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink][st-flash]] in order to interact with the STM32
*** Progress / Milestones
- [X] Create LED matrix driver for MAX7219 devices
- [X] Drive LED matrix from STM32 using FreeRTOS
- [X] Run FFT off target
- [X] Verify FFT on target (using off target results as a guide)
- [X] Verify that LED matrix can be driven alongside FFT code (manually verified, no delays etc.)
- [X] Capture data from mic
- [X] Verify output of mic from raw logic analyser data (using SigPlotI2S)
- [X] Capture data from mic via DMA
- [X] Perform FFT on this raw logic analyser data with a sine wave test tone (off-target)
- [X] Animate FFT graphs to get a rough estimate of how the LED matrix will display it (off-target)

- [X] Perform FFT on captured mic data to drive LED matrix
*** I2S Mic FFT Data Visualised
**** Logic Analyser Data (Sine 1kHz Test Tone)
FFT size = 64, start offset = 0, next offset = 32, FPS = 4

[[file:media/python_fft_logic_analyser_sine_1k.gif]]
**** Spekky Matrix Calculations
FFT size = 64, bin resolution = (1/60E-6)/64 --> ~260Hz

Note: I measured one Ws period as 60us on PulseView hence the 1/60E-6 above
***** 8x32 LED Matrix (Sine 2kHz Test Tone)
Peak expected at the 7th/8th bin (2000 / 260 = ~7.69)

***** 8x32 LED Matrix (Sine 4kHz Test Tone)
Peak expected at the 15th/16th bin (4000 / 260 = ~15.36)

***** 8x32 LED Matrix (Sine Sweep Test)
Since the I2S Ws period is 60us, this gives us a sampling frequency of 16.66 kHz.
 Giving us a visual representation of 0-8.88 kHz with Spekky Matrix

CMSIS will also produce linker warnings due to newlib e.g. "_write is not
implemented and will always fail". There is quite a bit of a size overhead
when pulling in all the CMSIS modules. An average project would be
around ~100Mb. This increases with FreeRTOS too.
