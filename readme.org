** Spekky Matrix
A FreeRTOS based project were a spectrum analyser is displayed on a LED matrix board run from a STM32 device
*** Tools
The following tools are needed to build this project
- make
- [[https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm][arm-none-eabi-gcc]]
- [[https://gcc.gnu.org/][gcc]] (for unit tests)
- [[https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink][st-flash]] in order to interact with the STM32
*** Submodules
- [[https://www.freertos.org/][FreeRTOS]]
- [[https://www.arm.com/technologies/cmsis][CMSIS V6]]
- [[https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32g4xx-nucleo-bsp][STM32G4xx Nucleo BSP]]
- [[https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32g4xx_hal_driver][STM32G4 HAL]]
- [[https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/cmsis_device_g4][CMSIS G4]] CMSIS device library
- [[https://github.com/silentbicycle/greatest][Greatest]] C test framework
  
CMSIS will also produce linker warnings due to newlib e.g. "_write is not implemented and will
always fail". Another linker warning will appear too: elf has a LOAD segment with RWX permissions.
There is quite a bit of a size overhead when pulling in all the CMSIS modules. An average project
would be around ~100Mb.
