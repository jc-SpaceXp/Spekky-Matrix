** Spekky Matrix
A FreeRTOS based project were a spectrum analyser is displayed on a LED matrix board run from a STM32 device
*** Detailed Description
A series of cascaded STP16CP05 LED IC drivers forms a 8x32 SMD (0603 Imperial)
LED matrix. This LED matrix then displays the fast fourier transform (FFT) of
an incoming audio signal picked up by a I2S digital microphone. The incoming
audio is a double buffered DMA signal. The LED matrix is driven via the
STM32's SPI interface. All while internal hardware timers and FreeRTOS are
responsible for accurate timing e.g. refresh rate of LED matrix and data
acquisition.

The Manhattan prototype uses a MAX7219 based 8x8 LED matrix breakout board
which was then cascaded to for a 8x32 LED matrix as well. In the PCB version
the STP16CP05 LED IC driver replaces the MAX7219 8x8 LED matrix.

*** I2S Mic FFT Data Visualised
**** Logic Analyser Data (Sine 1kHz Test Tone)
FFT size = 64, start offset = 0, next offset = 32, FPS = 4

[[file:media/python_fft_logic_analyser_sine_1k.gif]]
**** Spekky Matrix Calculations
FFT size = 64, bin resolution = (1/60E-6)/64 --> ~260Hz

Note: I measured one Ws period as 60us on PulseView hence the 1/60E-6 above
***** 8x32 LED Matrix (Sine 2kHz Test Tone)
Peak expected at the 7th/8th bin (2000 / 260 = ~7.69)

***** 8x32 LED Matrix (Sine 4kHz Test Tone)
Peak expected at the 15th/16th bin (4000 / 260 = ~15.36)

***** 8x32 LED Matrix (Sine Sweep Test)
Since the I2S Ws period is 60us, this gives us a sampling frequency of 16.66 kHz.
 Giving us a visual representation of 0-8.88 kHz with Spekky Matrix

**** PCB v01 Test Patterns
Only displaying test patterns on PCB as v01 has the I2S footprint in the wrong orientation.

Attempted fix hasn't worked, PCB revision v04 contains fixed I2S footprint and test points.

CMSIS will also produce linker warnings due to newlib e.g. "_write is not
implemented and will always fail". There is quite a bit of a size overhead
when pulling in all the CMSIS modules. An average project would be
around ~100Mb. This increases with FreeRTOS too.
